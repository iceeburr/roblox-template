# Cookbook

Oftentimes, you might be stuck on a small problem. You want to create something
specific, but don't know how to do it with Fusion's tools.

The cookbook can help with that! It's a collection of snippets which show you
how to do various small tasks with Fusion, like processing arrays, applying
animations and responding to different events.
