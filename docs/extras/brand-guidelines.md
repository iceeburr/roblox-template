The Fusion branding is designed to be simplistic, modern, easy to recognise and
distinctive.

## Colours

### Primaries

These colours are used in the Fusion logo and most illustrations. They might not
be suitable for text or all backgrounds.

## Best Practices

We would love you to use the Fusion branding in your own work, but please be
mindful that you use it appropriately. If you're not sure, feel free to reach
out over Discord or Twitter - it's always better to ask first to be secure!

These aren't hard and fast rules, and we can't and don't want to police how
people use our stuff. Instead, these are provided as best practices to follow.
We'll add any common examples or questions to this list over time.

### Brand Confusion

Fusion's logo and name are designed to represent Fusion's official projects.
Please don't use them to represent things that are not Fusion; for example, if
you build your own UI library, it's better to design a new logo.

In general, prefer to keep some distance between your project branding and
Fusion's branding, enough distance that people don't get confused about who
makes what, or whether a project is officially supported or not.

It's a good litmus test to imagine a first-time user who knows nothing about
Fusion, and how they will perceive your project.

!!! fail "Don't do this"
    ![A recoloured Fusion logo with the text: Fusion 2 - Build your best UI, but bestier.](Fusion-2-Dark.svg#only-dark)
    ![A recoloured Fusion logo with the text: Fusion 2 - Build your best UI, but bestier.](Fusion-2-Light.svg#only-light)

    In this example, someone made their own UI library and named it Fusion 2.
    Note that this is an extreme example for demonstration purposes - most
    violations of this principle are probably more subtle.

    This is bad because people might mistakenly think the official Fusion
    project approves or provides support for this unrelated project, which would
    cause many headaches and is dishonest about the relationship between the
    two libraries. Plus, in this example, we reserve the right to update Fusion
    to version 2 at any time, which would immediately cause a naming conflict.



!!! success "Instead, do this"
    ![A distinct logo with the text: InfuseTS - A Fusion-like library for TypeScript](InfuseTS-Dark.svg#only-dark)
    ![A distinct logo with the text: InfuseTS - A Fusion-like library for TypeScript](InfuseTS-Light.svg#only-light)

    This logo makes it more clear that the project is not a port of, update to
    or bindings for the Fusion library. Instead, it's a completely distinct
    project which only takes inspiration from Fusion, but is otherwise unrelated.

    It's okay for the logo to remind people of Fusion's design. Remember - you
    don't have to be completely original, just distinct enough that it isn't
    confusing for people.

!!! warning "Acceptable, but be careful"
    ![A plugin using the Fusion logo to represent a 'Convert to Fusion' action.](Fusion-Plugin-Toolbar-Dark.png#only-dark)
    ![A plugin using the Fusion logo to represent a 'Convert to Fusion' action.](Fusion-Plugin-Toolbar-Light.png#only-light)

    Here, this plugin is using the Fusion logo to represent a 'Convert to
    Fusion' action. This is fine, because users will understand the Fusion logo
    represents the thing being converted to.

    However, be careful, as free-standing uses of the Fusion icon like this can
    easily become confusing. Make sure people understand the logo represents
    Fusion, and not the plugin, so confusion between the two is minimised.
