# Security
### I found a very very bad issue! It must be fixed quickly.
Please immediately open a vulnerability issue on GitHub or privately report it to me. It will be immediately checked out.

> ***Security vulnerabilities are not general issues. If you want to report a bug, please do it by opening a bug report. If you report a vulnerability publicly, bad actors can use it to their advantage. This is why you should report them privately. Such issues include even libraries used in a project. If an issue is seen on them, please first report it to their maintainers and then here. After all this is only a template, we can only make sure the boilerplate code included here is safe to use.***
